				<span>fixes and refinements.</span>
				<small>2024-03-01</small>
			</h1>
			<p>increased sprinting speed, but slower sprinting animation.</p>
			<p>capped the sway effect.</p>
			<p>fixed the flickery lagspike issue.</p>
			<p>fixed the crazy headcrouching bug.</p>
			<p>refactored gimbal code to be radian-based, so mouse sensitivity has changed.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h1>
				<span>pimsley improvements.</span>
				<small>2024-02-29</small>
			</h1>
			<p>fixed the triangle bug when jumping.</p>
			<p>added leading weapon sway effect.</p>
			<p>added middle-click bind to switch cam.</p>
			<p>added crude orbit cam feature via z key.</p>
			<p>unfortunately there's some unseemly choppy flickery stuff going on right now, hopefully i can fix that next day.</p>

				<span>üèÉ pimsley.</span>
				<small>2024-02-29</small>
			</h1>
			<p>pimsley is our new base character. he is the perfect man and has zero flaws. men want to be him, and women want to sleep with him.</p>
			<p>first person view. it's crude and janky, but it's awesome. press R while you're pimsley to try it out. you can see your feets.</p>
			<p>new hip swivel and leg readjustment animations.</p>
			<p>crouching while walking in third person causes a hilarious bug with your head, among other quirks..</p>
			<p>level switching now puts you into spectator mode. on mountainside you'll still have to fly up until you're above the ground.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h1>
				<span>levels menu.</span>
				<small>2024-02-28</small>
			</h1>
			<p>now we have a level switcher menu.</p>
			<p>you'll still fall through the map if you aren't in spectator mode though, so watch out.</p>
			<p>the menu system has little back and forward buttons, with nifty hotkeys.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h1>
				<span>some refinements.</span>
				<small>2024-02-27</small>
			</h1>
			<p>new tab menu system.</p>
			<p>fixed a super-annoying chrome bug which caused occasional janky mouselook-snapping.</p>
			<p>optimized all the shader images, which should improve mountainside's download time very much.</p>

				<span>the next morning</span>
				<small>2024-02-25</small>
			</h1>
			<p>this morning, lonnie and i added custom shaders for the wrynth_dungeon for water, skylights, and the liquid mercury.</p>
			<p>i added a maxLights configuration based on quality setting. fancy mode can show all the lights on the wrynth_dungeon.</p>
			<p>we gave my parents a demo, and my dad's going to make music and help us with sound effects.</p>

			<h1>
				<span>üéâ make humanoid great again</span>
				<small>2024-02-25</small>
			</h1>
			<p>we brought back the knight character.</p>
			<p>now all the maps have physics.</p>
			<p>alternate between knight and spectator mode</p>
			<p>level switching.</p>
			<p>thin instancing, which improves mountainside's framerate.</p>
			<p>we made mountainside shiny. it sports a fresh coat of custom shader terrain, new env lighting, etc.. it was horrible bingus to get working.</p>
			<p>fix ssr and ssao by reverting some optimizations.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h1>
				<span>new levels.</span>
				<small>2024-02-23</small>
			</h1>
			<p>added four levels.</p>
			<p>added the new "quality" menu.</p>
			<p><strong>thin instances!</strong> we've thinnified the foliage on mountainside, for some reason some of the trees turn naked, more research is needed..</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h1>new notes menu</h1>
			<p>all new fancy menus system.</p>
			<p>settings menu totally redone.</p>
			<p>fixed the rendering pipeline bugs.</p>
			<p>increased precision granularity on sliders.</p>
