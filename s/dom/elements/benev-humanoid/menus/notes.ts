			<h1>welcome to humanoid.</h1>
			<p>the humanoid sandbox is an open source web game template.</p>
			<p>we're building it so we can make a cool game. join our <a target=_blank href="https://discord.gg/BnZx2utdev">discord</a> community.</p>

				<span>levels menu.</span>
				<small>2024-02-28</small>
			</h1>
			<p>now we have a level switcher menu.</p>
			<p>you'll still fall through the map if you aren't in spectator mode though, so watch out.</p>
			<p>the menu system has little back and forward buttons, which you can also activate by pressing q or e. so you hit tab, then q/e to cycle through different menus, i think that's nifty.</p>

				<span>some refinements.</span>
				<small>2024-02-27</small>
			</h1>
			<p>ðŸ†• press 'tab' to toggle the new tab menu system.</p>
			<p>fixed a super-annoying chrome bug which caused occasional janky mouselook-snapping.</p>
			<p>optimized all the shader images, which should improve mt_pimsley's download time very much.</p>

				<span>the next morning</span>
				<small>2024-02-25</small>
			</h1>
			<p>this morning, lonnie and i added custom shaders for the wrynth_dungeon for water, skylights, and the liquid mercury.</p>
			<p>i added a maxLights configuration based on quality setting. fancy mode can show all the lights on the wrynth_dungeon.</p>
			<p>we gave my parents a demo, and my dad's going to make music and help us with sound effects.</p>

			<p>ðŸ†• press R to alternate between knight and spectator mode</p>
			<p>ðŸ†’ press Y to switch levels.</p>
			<p>implemented thin instancing, which improves mt_pimsley's framerate.</p>
			<p>we made mt_pimsley shiny. it sports a fresh coat of custom shader terrain, new env lighting, etc.. it was horrible bingus to get working.</p>
			<p>fix ssr and ssao by reverting some optimizations.</p>
