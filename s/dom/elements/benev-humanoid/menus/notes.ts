				<span>full 270-degree attack system.</span>
				<small>2024-03-24</small>
			</h1>
			<p>now you can swing your sword in any direction, except straight up/down.</p>
			<p>you can also parry and stab.</p>
			<p>added a new 'settings' menu, where you can change your mouse sensitivity and set reticule preferences.</p>

				<span>we fixed pimsley's butt.</span>
				<small>2024-03-14</small>
			</h1>
			<p>pimsley's leg/hip swiveling mechanics have been improved.</p>
			<p>we're in the middle of reworking pimsley's animations, so some stuff is a bit janky.</p>
			<p>implemented dual-ribbon sword tracing. the outer-part of the ribbon is a grace-zone that is allowed to clip through the environment, but can still deal damage.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h1>
				<span>improved sword tracing.</span>
				<small>2024-03-13</small>
			</h1>
			<p>today when you swing your sword you'll see a pretty ribbon representing the path of your blade.</p>
			<p>hitting a part of the environment will cancel the attack.</p>
			<p>if you're nimble, you can strike the hanging heavy bags and watch them react.</p>

				<span>wip sword tracing.</span>

			<p>wip sword tracing.</p>
			<p>today you'll see a tracer on the sword. i'm starting to work on its collision detection.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h1>
				<span>fixed stuck keys.</span>

			<p>fixed ijkl keylook sensitivity.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h1>
				<span>added mt_finny level prototype.</span>
				<small>2024-03-09</small>
			</h1>
			<p>it still has some issues.</p>
			<p>totally rewrote the physics integration.. i spent too long finagling it.. at least i added a cube to the gym.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h1>
				<span>sword attack.</span>
				<small>2024-03-03</small>
			</h1>
			<p>added left-click to play sword attack animation. it just phases through stuff, doesn't interact with anything.. yet..</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h1>
				<span>fixes and refinements.</span>
				<small>2024-03-01</small>
			</h1>
			<p>increased sprinting speed, but slower sprinting animation.</p>
			<p>capped the sway effect.</p>
			<p>fixed the flickery lagspike issue.</p>
			<p>fixed the crazy headcrouching bug.</p>
			<p>refactored gimbal code to be radian-based, so mouse sensitivity has changed.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h1>
				<span>pimsley improvements.</span>
				<small>2024-02-29</small>
			</h1>
			<p>fixed the triangle bug when jumping.</p>

			<h1>
				<span>üèÉ pimsley.</span>
				<small>2024-02-29</small>
			</h1>
			<p>pimsley is our new base character. he is the perfect man and has zero flaws. men want to be him, and women want to sleep with him.</p>
			<p>first person view. it's crude and janky, but it's awesome. press R while you're pimsley to try it out. you can see your feets.</p>
			<p>new hip swivel and leg readjustment animations.</p>
			<p>crouching while walking in third person causes a hilarious bug with your head, among other quirks..</p>
			<p>level switching now puts you into spectator mode. on mountainside you'll still have to fly up until you're above the ground.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h1>
				<span>levels menu.</span>
				<small>2024-02-28</small>
			</h1>
			<p>now we have a level switcher menu.</p>
			<p>you'll still fall through the map if you aren't in spectator mode though, so watch out.</p>
			<p>the menu system has little back and forward buttons, with nifty hotkeys.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h1>
				<span>some refinements.</span>
				<small>2024-02-27</small>
			</h1>
			<p>new tab menu system.</p>
			<p>fixed a super-annoying chrome bug which caused occasional janky mouselook-snapping.</p>
			<p>optimized all the shader images, which should improve mountainside's download time very much.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h1>
				<span>the next morning</span>
				<small>2024-02-25</small>
			</h1>
			<p>this morning, lonnie and i added custom shaders for the wrynth_dungeon for water, skylights, and the liquid mercury.</p>
			<p>i added a maxLights configuration based on quality setting. fancy mode can show all the lights on the wrynth_dungeon.</p>
			<p>we gave my parents a demo, and my dad's going to make music and help us with sound effects.</p>

		<section>
			<h1>
				<span>üéâ make humanoid great again</span>
				<small>2024-02-25</small>
			</h1>
			<p>we brought back the knight character.</p>
			<p>now all the maps have physics.</p>
			<p>alternate between knight and spectator mode</p>
			<p>level switching.</p>
			<p>thin instancing, which improves mountainside's framerate.</p>
			<p>we made mountainside shiny. it sports a fresh coat of custom shader terrain, new env lighting, etc.. it was horrible bingus to get working.</p>
			<p>fix ssr and ssao by reverting some optimizations.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h1>
				<span>new levels.</span>
				<small>2024-02-23</small>
			</h1>
			<p>added four levels.</p>

			<p><strong>thin instances!</strong> we've thinnified the foliage on mountainside, for some reason some of the trees turn naked, more research is needed..</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h1>new notes menu</h1>
			<p>all new fancy menus system.</p>
